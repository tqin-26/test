# test-assignment
The first day of class we will talk about creating version controlled projects in Rstudio. This first test assignment will count as extra credit and will give you a chance to practice the process of submitting assignments to GitHub. 

Before day 2 of class, I will expect you to have reviewed: 

- [GitHub Classroom guide](https://github.com/econ122-f23/github-classroom-for-students)

Then create a version controlled project for this test assignment using the repository that was automatically created after you accepted the GitHub Classroom assignment link. After creating this project, you will then have the file `test-activity.Rmd` in your `test-assignment` project folder. To complete this activity

1. Go through the  `.Rmd` file and follow the directions given in the file
2. `Knit` the file to produce an `.md` file as an output that runs all the code and contains your answers
3. `commit` and `push` your changes to your GitHub repository
4. Go to the GitHub site to confirm that your changes have been properly pushed
